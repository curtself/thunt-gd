Simi-working gameplay with bugs.

Needs attention:
	Key match detections
		User matches should ALWAYS use the piece that was moved by the user.
		Cascading matches can use mid-point pieces as key matches.

	Gameplay timers need to be reworked.
		Currently is buggy when upgrades match.
		Also sometimes refills happen before pieces collapse. I this is because 
			collapse_pieces gets called too many times. Check the console while
			speed matching and see how many debug statements there are for collapse_pieces
