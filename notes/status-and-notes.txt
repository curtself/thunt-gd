Semi-working gameplay with bugs.
(small change)

Starting offset variables
width: 8
height: 8
x_start: 342
y_start: 549
offset: 64
y_offset:
starting_moves: 15


Need to:
	- figure out how to manage storage cross-platform so I can save/load game state.
	- add in-game pause menu with quit, home, continue options
